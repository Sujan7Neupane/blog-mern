Welcome to My MERN Blog Application, a clean, secure, and feature-rich blogging platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This project reflects my ongoing journey as a full‑stack developer, focusing on authentication, authorization, data security, and smooth user experience.

📝 Overview

This blog platform allows users to register, log in, and create their own posts. Every post is fully protected — meaning only the author can edit or delete it. The structure prioritizes security, clean API design, modularity, and scalability.

The goal of this project is to build a real-world blogging system with proper access control, clean UI, and a stable backend.

🧩 Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js, React Hooks, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, JWT Authentication, Bcrypt
Database: MongoDB with Mongoose
Tools: Vite, Axios, Postman, Git & GitHub

✨ Key Features

User Registration & Login – Secure JWT authentication

Role-Based Actions – Only logged-in users can create posts

Post Management – Create, edit, and delete posts

Author Protection – Users cannot edit or delete posts from others

Profile Section – Each user has their own account dashboard

🛠️ Current Status

The core blog features are fully functional:

Users can register and log in

Authenticated users can add posts

A smooth dashboard experience is available

I am actively improving the platform by refining the UI, optimizing backend queries, and restructuring code for cleaner scalability.
